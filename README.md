# S-L Project Template

This template will help you get started with your project. Please look through all these materials so you know how to organize your project.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine. E.g., in your terminal / command prompt `CD` to where you want this the folder for this activity to be. Then run `git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>`.

1. `CD` or open a terminal / command prompt window into the cloned folder.

1. Start a simple python webserver. E.g., `python -m http.server`, `python3 -m http.server`, or `py -m http.server`. If you are using python 2 you will need to use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` instead, but please switch to python 3.

1. Wait for the output: `Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/)`.

1. Now open your web browser (Firefox or Chrome) and navigate to the URL: http://localhost:8000
